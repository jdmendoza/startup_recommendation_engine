# Startup Recommendation Engine

Description: Used K-Means clustering + NLP techniques on 20014-2014 CrunchBase data to recommend SF startups for job-seekers and investors. Rather than using a rigid approach like CrunchBaseâ€™s search engine (filtering with rules), my engine uses an exploratory approach.
